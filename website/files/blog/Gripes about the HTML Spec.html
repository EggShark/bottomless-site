                <p>Why did I write an HTML parser? I'm not trying to make a web browser.</p>
                <p>
                    It started with the problem of dynamically loading in blog posts. How do I "post" one?
                    How do I know when it was posted, the title, etc?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The obvious answer is to just use a Content Management System, but my stubbornness refused
                    to let me do this. So instead, I decided to create my own metadata file called CBMD. The
                    specification of CBMD is simple as the file is small and stores very little information.
                    The first byte contains the length of the title, followed by the title. Then, another
                    byte contains the length of the subtitle. One byte contains the URL path length, followed
                    by the URL. Finally, the last 8 bytes contain the seconds since the UNIX epoch that the
                    post was published on.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/cbmd diagram.svg" alt="diagram demostrating the byte layout of metadata file">
                <p>
                    While having raw bytes and serialized data is nice, it complicates the process of producing
                    and editing the files. A standard like JSON is human readable and editable. Meanwhile,
                    the only way to manually edit mine would be through a hex editor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This problem necessitated the creation of a tool designed to create these metadata files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how to go about this? Manually insert data? Extract the data from the blog HTML? Create a
                    GUI to generate files?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to extract the data straight from the HTML files, which means I need to parse
                    HTML somehow. My solution involved having each blog file having metadata like:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;meta title="Best Ways to Live">
&lt;meta publish-date="01/01/1970">
&lt;meta intro="you can live by breathing"></code></pre>
                <p>
                    Now, I need to be able to extract this data somehow. A simple solution could be to search
                    the file for "intro" and then take all the data inside the quotation marks. This solution
                    could have many flaws. If the string `introduction` exists it would take that data and
                    be incorrect. In order to be able to parse HTML no matter how it's formatted I decided to
                    just make a full HTML parser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My design is inspired by Jlox or the language created in the book
                    <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Crafting Interpreters</i></a>
                    by Robert Nystrom.
                    Unlike Jlox, mine stops after the parsing step as there is no way to run/interpret HTML
                    code. My parser still does every step like a real interpreter/parser would by turning
                    the text into tokens. Then the tokens are parsed into meaningful data like the tags and
                    their children and attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mostly winged my implementation based on my loose knowledge of the HTML syntax and grammar.
                    This means that mine does not follow the exact specification. It still worked for my needs and
                    has passed all of my use cases. Although in certain situations it will not work. Take:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script>
    if (a&lt;2) {
        console.log("a is less than 2");
    }
&lt;/script></code></pre>
                <p>
                    My parser would see a tag starting inside the if block and that would break the parser. I
                    don't see my blogs containing inline scripts so I have swept this issue under the rug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, let's talk about the official HTML specification, specifically the parsing errors
                    section found
                    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
                    Most of the errors are pretty reasonable, like EOF (End Of File) inside comments, tag, doctype,
                    etc. Finding an EOF early can break a lot of things and there is not much a parser can do to
                    recover in that situation other than tell the user. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My problems begin with the error "abrupt-closing-of-empty-comment." Which states that an empty
                    comment that ends early (not having the full --&gt;) should be treated like it was closed
                    properly. Or the "incorrectly-closed-comment" error that says if a comment is closed with --!&gt;
                    it should be treated as being closed correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What these "errors" tell is that they aren't errors. There are just multiple ways of closing
                    comments. If an HTML parser that is completely to specification will just ignore these "errors"
                    and function as expected, then there are no errors present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another of these "errors" is the "missing-whitespace-between-attributes." Like its name says
                    that not having whitespace between attributes name is an error. Code like:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"href="../css/index.css"></code></pre>
                <p>
                    would be considered incorrect and full of errors. A strange consequence of this means that
                    every minified page is filled with errors everywhere. Yet the specification says to pretend
                    there is white space once again giving a fake error. Several errors follow the same
                    convention of "missing" whitespace. Errors like "missing-whitespace-before-doctype-name"
                    and "missing-whitespace-between-doctype-public-and-system-identifiers" all say to
                    pretend the whitespace exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand having style guidelines for a programming language. Nearly every language has
                    one. Rust likes variable names in snake_case while JavaScript prefers variable names to be
                    in camelCase. The difference between having whitespace and not having whitespace is a style
                    preference especially when the parser is told to ignore it. This makes it optional whitespace
                    and up to the personal preference of the programmer. Having a non-conventional case style
                    would not be considered an error and doing <code class="language-rust">let x=10;</code>
                    be considered an error compared to <code class="language-rust">let x = 10;</code> in Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Admittedly this is a super minor complaint that doesn't even matter. I already said mine
                    wasn't up to specification and I have no plans to make it up to specification. Only the
                    people developing browsers, scrapers or any other HTML parser will read or care about
                    the HTML specification. I just personally don't like how some of these "errors" are
                    not truly errors. Join me next time when I create another over-engineered solution and
                    find something new to complain about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a little bonus here is the awful code that goes into parsing byte arrays in JavaScript.
                    I'm sure there are better ways to do it, but I rarely use JavaScript so I don't know how to.
