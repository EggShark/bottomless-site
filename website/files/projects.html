                            Bottomless-Pit is the first major porject I ever completed. In its current position (version 0.1.1), Bottomless-Pit
                            is more of a rendering engine than a game engine. Despite its infancy, I belive it is fully capable for small games as 
                            Bottomless-Pit has:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>texture rendering</li>
                            <li>input handling (mouse and keyboard only)</li>
                            <li>text rendering using wgpu-glyph (plans to write a custom one)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            My current priority is to add gamepad support and an audio system.

                            Bottomless-Site is the website/webserver that you are using right now. The front end is nothing special as everything
                            is vanilla JS/CSS/HTML, and no frameworks are used. I am much more proud of the back end, which is written complety by hand
                            in Rust. The backend is basic, but I am most proud of is the API system. It is just a hashmap of functions with
                            the path acting as the key. On top of the API, I needed to add rate limiting. The rate limiter uses the client's IP address
                            to identify them. I would like to change this later as if there are multiple people on the same IP then they can use up
                            each others' requests.
